# NBA_Analysis
In this project I will examine and analyze all shot attempts(excluding free throws) that occured in the last two decades in the NBA, using MSSQL, Python and Power BI.
Data source: nba.com via https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_24/tree/main The rational for how I decided to turn the data into relational tables is explained in the DB creation script itself.
