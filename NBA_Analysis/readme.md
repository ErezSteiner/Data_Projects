In this project I will examine and analyze all shot attempts(excluding free throws) that occur in a particular NBA season, using MSSQL, Python and Power BI.  
For the SQL part of this project I will use this data:
Data source: nba.com via https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_24/tree/main
The rational for how I decided to turn the data into relational tables is explained in the DB creation script itself.
Currently the plan is to insert only the 2024 season into the SQL DB.

For the Python part of this project I will get the data directly in python via the NBA API.
